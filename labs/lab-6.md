## Lab 6

In this lab we will:

- launch Vagrant and interact with it
- SSH into the VM and create some more files with `artisan` tool
- validate sent data for `create` and `update` methods of `UsersController` through Requests classes
- add extra endpoints in `SkillsController` and `UsersSkillsController` through artisan
- create a new Model named `Vacation`
- create `UsersVacationsController` through artisan
- add endpoints for creating, updating and deleting a vacation
- validate sent data for `create` and `update` methods of `SkillsController` and `UsersVacationsController` through Requests classes
- add a class named `Department`. Departments should have a `title` attribute
- each user should belong to one department and each department should have many users
- each department should have a manager responsible for it. This manager is one of the users
- a user can be a manager of just one department
- create migration, factory and seeder files for the departments
- add a `DepartmentsController` to run CRUD operations for departments
- add a method to define a department's manager inside `DepartmentsController`
- add a `DepartmentsUsersController` and add endpoints for adding and removing users from departments

### User Story

As a user, I should be able to add vacations for users through the API.

As a user, I should be able to create departments through the API.

As a user, I should be able to bind departments with users through the API.

As a user, I should be able to define each department's manager through the API.

As a user, I should not be able to send over invalid data when running CRUD operations through all API endpoints.

### Step 1

Launch a brand new VM with Vagrant if you haven't already done so

### Step 2

SSH into the VM and navigate into the Laravel's files and folders

### Step 3

Launch artisan and check the available options

### Step 4

Add a new `Request` class named `UsersStoreRequest` to validate inputs for `store` method in `UsersController`

Add a new `Request` class named `UsersUpdateRequest` to validate inputs for `update` method in `UsersController`

### Step 5

Add endpoint POST `/api/skills` in `SkillsController@store` and use Eloquent to create new `skills`

Use `apiResource` to declare this route

The only attribute you need to send over through curl is the `title`

### Step 6

Add a new `Request` class named `SkillsStoreRequest` to validate inputs for `store` method

Remember that each skill should be unique in the `skills` table

### Step 7

Add endpoint PUT `/api/skills/:id` in `SkillsController@update` and use Eloquent to update an existing `skill`

Use `apiResource` to declare this route

The only attribute you need to send over through curl is the `title`

### Step 8

Add a new `Request` class named `SkillsUpdateRequest` to validate inputs for `update` method

Remember that each skill should be unique in the `skills` table

### Step 9

Add endpoint DELETE `/api/skills/:id` in `SkillsController@destroy` and use Eloquent to delete an existing `skill`

### Step 10

Add endpoint POST `/api/users/:id/skills` in `UsersSkillsController@store` and use Eloquent to attach an array of `skills` to a `user`

Use `apiResource` to declare this route

The only attribute you need to send over through curl is an array of skills ids

### Step 11

Add a new `Request` class named `UsersSkillsStoreRequest` to validate inputs for `store` method

Remember that each skill should actually exist in the `skills` table

### Step 12

Add `Vacation` model with its migration file through artisan and connect it with one-to-many relationship with `User` model

### Step 13

Add fields `from` and `to` that should be dates in the migration file and field `user_id` to connect each vacation entry with one user

The fields `from` and `to` indicate when a vacation starts and when it ends

### Step 14

Add factories and seeders for vacations through artisan

### Step 15

Run the migration command by adding the seed option and check the new `vacations` table in MySQL

```
$ php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Step 16

Add a new controller named `UsersVacationsController` through artisan

### Step 17

Add endpoints for `index`, `show`, `store`, `update` and `destroy` methods of `UsersVacationsController` and use model binding

### Step 18

Add requests classes through Artisan to validate data sent over to the API through endpoints POST `/api/users/:user/vacations` and PUT `/users/:user/vacations/:vacation`

### Step 19

Create the `Department` model alongside a migration, factory and seeder.

### Step 20

Create the `DepartmentsController` and add endpoints to run CRUD operations for departments

### Step 21

Add a method to define a department's manager inside `DepartmentsController`

### Step 22

Add a `DepartmentsUsersController` and add endpoints for adding and removing users from departments

### Step 23

Ensure that there are migrations, factories and seeders for all models and relationships

### Step 24

Ensure that there are Requests classes protecting all the endpoints you created so far so that no-one can enter invalid data

### Notes

If you find it more convenient compared with Curl, feel free to use [httpie](https://httpie.io/) cli tool to test your API endpoints.
